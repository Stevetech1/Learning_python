Bouncing Ball:

Create the bouncing ball game as seen in the video above using all that you have learned this week

 

 How to play:

 The user is to control a paddle at the bottom of the screen. The paddle can go left or right

 If the ball hits the paddle it should bounce back towards the bricks and it doesn't hit the

 paddle the user loses and GAME OVER will be written on the screen

 If the ball hits the bricks then the bricks should disappear and when there are no more bricks

 on the screen CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WIN should be displayed on the screen.

 Hint:

      - Create the bricks class

           - Create the Paddle class

                - Create a ball class

                     - Create a main class
